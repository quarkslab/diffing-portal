Diaphora
========

`Diaphora <https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora/>`_ is another main diffing tool that is used for industrial purposes. A new version, the 3.0, was released in 2023. Diaphora offers a variety of features that are used to compute the diff between two binaries, some of which are common to BinDiff and QBinDiff.

Contrary to other differs, Diaphora uses a sequential process to output matches : a set of rules are defined to establish the matches. These rules are executed from the most reliable query to the less reliable one. Each query can produce new matches.

More details can be found on the `Diaphora Github repository <https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora/>`_.
