Quokka
======

Introduction
------------

`Quokka <https://github.com/quarkslab/quokka>`_ is a binary exporter provided by Quarkslab, similar to BinExport, but that offers more features. For example, BinExport does not export data references, Quokka does. However, Quokka is only compatible with IDA Pro (a ghidra plugin is currently under development).
