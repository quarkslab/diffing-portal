# Diffing Portal

This documentation aims to provide various resources on binary diffing which is handy for
reverse-engineering. Tools and associated publications related to diffing are slightly
scattered online thus the goal is to reference them here by centralizing information.

You can find the documentation online at [https://diffing.quarkslab.com/](https://diffing.quarkslab.com/)
